- Installing bluecove:

for ubuntu version:
sudo apt-get install libbluetooth-dev

for fedora version:
yum install bluez-libs-devel

- Configuring the bluetooth deamon with the "-C" or "--compat" option:

Open a terminal and enter
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/bluetooth.target.wants/bluetooth.service
then change line
ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd
to
ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd -C
(simply adding the -C option)

Now you need to restart the system daemons: sudo systemctl daemon-reload
And finally restart the bluetooth service: sudo systemctl restart bluetooth

- Fixing SDP permission issue:

Open a terminal and enter
sudo chmod a+wrx /run/sdp

Note: you may need to run the above command (sudo chmod a+wrx /run/sdp) on session start because this does not seem to persist across reboots.
